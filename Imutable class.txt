Object fields (state) cannot be changed or modified.

It can be passed to any method without worrying about whether that method changes or modifies any of the object fields.

The object’s hash code can easily be cached.

These objects are a good choice for keys for Maps.

These objects are good for a multi-threaded environment as the object's state won’t change.

An immutable object’s state won’t change, so the same object can be used at multiple places and hence saving the memory.



1.Use of String Constant Pool:

The string pool is a group of string literals placed in the heap memory area. Many string variables with the same string literal or content can refer to the
 same string object from the string pool. By using this concept of string pool, a lot of memory can be easily saved by Java Virtual Machine. The below diagram explains the concept of the string pool.

2. Security :

 Strings are generally used in Java applications to store sensitive data like userName, password, etc. If strings were mutable then there would have
 been a chance that these strings like userName or password could be tempered/changed by some untrustworthy user.

3. Thread-Safety :
As the string objects are immutable, hence if they are accessed by multiple threads they won’t be changed and hence making it thread safer. Also, 
the same string object can be used by multiple threads.

4. Cacheable HashCode :
Strings are the most widely used objects in any java application. They are used in HashMap, HashTable, HashSet, etc. . Also note that the overridden hashCode() method 
of String class is quite frequently called for bucketing.As strings are immutable and hence, they won’t change, and hence when first-time hashCode() is called the 
hashcode of the string object is cached and later on, for frequent hashCode() method calls the same value is returned.

If we would have used the mutable objects with Collections like HashMap, HashSet, or HashTable, there could have been different hashcodes, one when object 
contents are not modified and the other when object contents are modified. Hence mutable objects should not be used as keys in Maps, if they are used in Maps, 
then we might lose the value associated with the keys in Map.

5. Improved Performance :

Generally, performance is directly linked with memory usages. As Strings are stored in a string pool and for multiple string variables having the same string 
contents there is only one instance stored in the string pool, which is already explained in above point 1. So, the string pool saves a lot of heap memory of 
Java Virtual Memory and hence performance of the application improves automatically.
